# Face Recognition with PCA
[Dataset: vision.caltech.edu/html-files/archive.html](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/html-files/archive.html)

### Hot to run the demo:
1. Download & move faces-dataset to the root directory of the project, name it 'face_images'
2. Run entire pca-face-recognition.ipynb notebook (creates principal component matrix and saves it)
3. Run `python demo_server.py` (localhost:5000)
