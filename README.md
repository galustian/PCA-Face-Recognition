# Face Recognition with PCA
Run the demo and have a look at the pca-face-recognition notebook to see how PCA is used to compare images.

[Dataset: vision.caltech.edu/html-files/archive.html](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/html-files/archive.html)

### Hot to run the demo:
1. Download & move faces-dataset in to a folder called `face_images` to the root directory of the project.
2. Run entire pca-face-recognition.ipynb notebook (creates principal component matrix and saves it).
3. Run `python demo_server.py` (localhost:5000).
